  <title>ほかのツールと共にWinMergeを使用する<indexterm>
      <primary>integration</primary>

  <para>Comparing and merging files are often subtasks in a larger change
  management process. For that reason, WinMerge is often not used by itself, but
  in conjunction with other tools. In addition, even though many programs have
  built-in diff and merge utilities, none provides all the features their users
  need, so it's sometimes handy to combine different tools. This topic describes
  the two important WinMerge features that facilitate working with other
  tools.</para>

  <section>
    <title>コマンドインターフェース(CLI)を使用する</title>

    <para>The WinMerge command-line interface (CLI), described in <xref
    linkend="CommandLine" />, enables you to run WinMerge from a Command Prompt
    window, from scripts, or from another tool or program. Basically, any
    program that allows you to call an external executable with at least one
    path, can be used to launch a WinMerge operation. </para>

    <para>Here are just a few examples:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>A batch file can launch WinMerge and enable users to specify
        parameters interactively:</para>

        <literallayout>start "WinMerge" /B "C:\Program Files\WinMerge\WinMergeU.exe" /e /s /ub /dl %3 /dr %5 %6 %7</literallayout>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The Subversion client allows you to call an external diff program
        and pass parameters, like this:</para>

        <literallayout>$ svn diff --diff-cmd "C:\Program Files\WinMerge\WinMergeU.exe" -x "-dl -dr" myfile </literallayout>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <tip>
      <para>Similarly, many GUI tools (like version control clients and IDEs)
      that include built-in diff tools enable you to configure WinMerge as their
      default diff tool, instead. Examples include TortoiseSVN, Eclipse, and
      Perforce. Check their documentation or search the Internet for details and
      examples.</para>

    <title>バージョンコントロールツールとの統合<indexterm>
      <primary>version control systems</primary>

      <secondary>integration with</secondary>
    </indexterm></title>

    <para>WinMerge can integrate some key functions with a few, specific version
    control system (VCS) tools. You can configure the optional VCS integrations
    during or after WinMerge installation.</para>

    <para>If the WinMerge installer detects that TortoiseSVN, TortoiseCVS, or
    Rational ClearCase are present on your system, the Setup Additional Tasks
    page contains options to enable any of the WinMerge integrations.</para>

    <para>After installation, you can open the Options dialog and configure
    either the ClearCase or Visual SourceSafe integration, as described in <xref
  linkend="Configuration_vcs" />.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Only the ClearCase integration can be configured using both methods.
    You can configure TortoiseSVN and TortoiseCVS only during installation;
    conversely, you can configure Visual SourceSafe (which is not detected by
    the installer) only in the Options dialog.</para>
  </note>

  <para>Each WinMerge version control integration has one of these basic types
  of interaction:</para>

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>WinMerge launches VCS file checkout</term>

      <listitem>
          <para>With version control systems that lock files (for example,
          ClearCase and Visual Source Safe), WinMerge opens the VCS's checkout
          dialog before saving a file. It is up to you to check out the file,
          and then to check in the file later using the version control system's
          tools. WinMerge does not provide checkin or history tools.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>VCS use WinMerge as its diff tool</term>

      <listitem>
          <para>When you start a diff operation using TortoiseSVN and
          TortoiseCVS, the integration opens WinMerge instead of the VCS
          client's own diff utility.</para>
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <example>
    <title>TortoiseSVNとの統合<indexterm>
        <primary>TortoiseSVN integration</primary>
      </indexterm></title>

    <para>TortoiseSVN is a Windows client for Subversion (SVN), an open source
    version control system. TortoiseSVN provides its own diff utility. The
    WinMerge integration with this VCS enables you to use WinMerge to compare
    files instead of the TortoiseSVN diff tool.</para>

    <para>One of the main uses of TortoiseSVN's diff is to see the most recent
    changes to a file that is under version control: that is, a file that you
    have checked out into a working copy. The following procedure illustrates
    such an operation using the WinMerge integration with TortoiseSVN. The
    integration with TortoiseCVS is similar.</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In Windows Explorer, navigate to a Subversion working copy that
        you have checked out.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Right-click a file that is under Subversion management (usually
        indicated by a distinct TortoiseSVN icon), and click
        <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu> in the context menu.</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>If the file has not been modified, the context menu contains
              the shortcut, <guimenuitem>Diff with previous
              version</guimenuitem>. This command compares the checked-out
              version of the file with the previous version that was checked in
              to the repository.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>If you have modified the file, the context menu contains the
              same <guimenuitem>Diff with previous version</guimenuitem>
              shortcut, plus the <guimenuitem>Diff</guimenuitem> shortcut. This
              command compares your revision to the current version (the one you
              checked out). It is useful for reviewing the changes you have
              made.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Choose either the <guimenuitem>Diff with previous
        version</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>Diff</guimenuitem> shortcut. The
          WinMerge window opens, with the target file versions loaded In the
          File Compare window.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>The <menuchoice>
        <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>

        <guimenuitem>Diff</guimenuitem>
      </menuchoice> shortcut is available for comparing any two files in your
    file system, not just files that are managed by Subversion. To illustrate
    how the WinMerge integration works in this case:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In Windows explorer, hold <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>, select any two
        files, and right-click.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Choose <menuchoice>
            <guimenu>TortoiseSVN</guimenu>

            <guimenuitem>Diff</guimenuitem>
          </menuchoice> in the context menu.</para>

        <para>The WinMerge window opens, with the selected files loaded In the
        File Compare window.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
  </example>

  <example>
    <title>Visual Source Safe との統合<indexterm>
        <primary>Visual SourceSafe integration</primary>
      </indexterm></title>

    <para>This example demonstrates the file checkout type of VCS
    integration.</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Launch a WinMerge file or folder comparison whose left or right
        target is under version control</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In WinMerge, edit a version-controlled file</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Save your changes. WinMerge detects that the file is read-only,
        and assumes that it is under Visual Source Safe version control.
        WinMerge opens a Visual Source Save dialog, like this:</para>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="screenshots/sourcesafe1.png" format="PNG" />
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>In the <guilabel>Database</guilabel> dropdown list, choose the
        correct Visual SourceSafe database if there is more than one on your
        system.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The <guilabel>Project</guilabel> field shows the selected file's
        location relative to the Visual SourceSafe database path. Verify that
        the path is correct: most errors are caused by the wrong project path.
          If you change folders, remember to change the project path,
          too!</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
          <para>Enter your password if required. WinMerge remembers your
          password for the current session, but for your security does not store
          it. Therefore, you don't need to retype the password during a session,
          but you must retype the password each time you open WinMerge.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Optionally, enable one or both of these options:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><guilabel>Link to Destination VSS project</guilabel></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><guilabel>Apply to all items</guilabel>. This option enables
              you to check out multiple files in a single directory when you
              copy files in a folder compare operation.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>Unfortunately, VSS provides very little information about error
      conditions beyond the fact that they occur. If an operation fails, causes
    might include any of the following conditions:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Another user might have the file checked out with exclusive
        access.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You might have specified the wrong project.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You might have entered the project name incorrectly.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>You might not have used a valid VSS path (for example, this is
        incorrect: <userinput>$/MyProject/res</userinput>).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
          <para>Your connection to the VSS server computer might be
          broken.</para>
